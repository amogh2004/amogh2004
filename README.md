### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am Amogh R, a Computer Science and Engineering Undergrad at K. S. Institute of Technology. I am a Programmer, and a highly driven individual, who wants to enhance and specialise in tech, looking to establish a career in the field of Information Technology. I build Machine Learning models, and optimise them considering the hyper-parameters. **Highly interested in Machine Learning and DevOps.**

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ðŸ¤”, well a lot of things!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a project or an internship on Machine Learning / Python Development / Java Development.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ðŸ‘†
